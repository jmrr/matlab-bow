#  Bag of Words Pipeline toolkit
                        
This is a Matlab toolkit that provides the necessary modules to construct a
typical bag of words pipeline for object recognition and categorisation 
purposes.

It is also an evaluation toolkit for the comparison of the different
algorithms that comprise the pipeline modules.

Requirements:
============

SIFT, DSIFT, VLAD and kernel implementations require VLFEAT (http://www.vlfeat.org/)
Clustering requires kmeans_bo.m by Liefeng Bo (http://research.cs.washington.edu/istc/lfb/).
LibSVM is used to implement SVM classification (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).
LLC_coding_appr.m is part of Matlab's LLC package (http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~jyang29/LLC.htm)

A downloadable version of the required libraries and code can be found in the 'Downloads' 
section of the repository. Link to libraries:

Data:
=====

This toolkit can be used with any dataset. However, a 4-object version of Caltech-101
is included in the 'Downloads' section of the repository. Link to 4-object Caltech-101:

Running Instructions:
====================

1. Run setup.m for the installation of the 3rd party libraries.
2. Run main.m 

Instructions for beginners:
==========================

A 'beginners' version of the toolkit, consisiting of a simple Hard Assignment bag-of-visual-words
model for object classification is included as BOVWdemo.m

Steps
-----

0. Download and unzip the bovw_pipeline_lib.zip from the 'Downloads' section.
1. Run setup.m
2. Run BOVWdemo.m
